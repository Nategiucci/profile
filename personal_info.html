<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p> My name is Nathaniel, I often go by Nate as it is much shorter and requires less effort to say. I am currently studying introduction to IT at RMIT. My student number is S3882512, and my student email is S3882512@student.rmit.edu.au. </p>
<p> I have spent nearly 15 years in the hospitality industry. with a strong background in gaming. I have been a duty manager in a few clubs around Canberra. While working in clubs I also owned and operated a small cleaning business for 6 years. I specialised in domestic cleaning but also had a few commercial contracts. During January of 2020 I decided to resign from my full-time role as Duty Manager so I could focus on building the cleaning business so I could sell it. 2 weeks after I resigned from the club I managed to become fully booked and started working 6 days per week, 2 weeks later we were hit with the pandemic, resulting in the sudden loss of 90% of my customer base. After trying to keep the business afloat for two months, I made the hardest decision of my life, which was to close the cleaning business indefinitely. After the business closed, I decided to try and up skill by enrolling into a Bachelor of Management. I have completed three units at a university level with a high credit average to date. </p>
<p> I have a 7-year-old Staffy cross Kelpie, her full name is Peanut Butter Jelly but responds to Peanut or Poodle. She likes to go for walks around the lake or play fetch up at the oval for hours on end. I have had peanut since she was 8 weeks old, when I went to the house where Peanut was being sold, she came bounding out of the house and came straight over to me, as she was coming across the yard to me, I said to my partner at the time that she looked like a peanut butter cup, and that is how she got the name Peanut.  through this time, we have become very close, and she has become my best friend. We do everything together, from going on trips to the coast to having a nap on the couch. Wherever I am, Peanut is not very far away.</p>
