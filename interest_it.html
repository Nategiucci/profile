<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have been interested in IT for a several years now. It all started back around the time of the 2016 Census from the Australian Bureau of Statistic and the DDos attack that caused the systems to be inaccessible. Learning about what a DDos attack was, sparked my interest in the IT industry specifically cyber security and ethical hacking. I wanted to learn what I could but was unable to commit to studying at the time because I was working fulltime doing shift work and was also operating a cleaning business during the daytime which meant that I had full schedule and couldn’t fit study into an already busy schedule. after the pandemic hit which forced me to cease trade for the business and was stood down from my role in club I was work at because they had to cease trade, I decided to undertake the study I was putting off for years. I spent months researching universities and degrees to try and find the best pathway for me to get into cyber security and ethical hacking. I enrolled into Data Analysis for Cyber Security at the university of Tasmania after struggling to understand what was happening throughout the semester as I didn’t have the necessary skills in order to be successfully with continuing studying at UTAS and discovered that the course I was enrolled into an associate degree and not a bachelor’s degree. Since discovering that I didn’t have the skills and being an associate degree, I spent my free time looking for an introductory course in IT, I spent months looking for an appropriate degree and a high calibre university. I decided to enrol into RMIT as it is one of the best universities for IT in Australia, this was the leading reason why I enrolled into RMIT, if I want to get a great degree it made sense to enrol into a great university. During my studies, I hope to gain the appropriate skills to successfully complete the IT degree and to understand what is expected to get good grades and hopefully be able to gain a master’s degree in cyber security. After completing a bachelor’s of IT, I hope to be able to apply for a graduate position within the Australian Public Service withing the security and cyber security branches, preferably in the department of foreign affairs and trade.</p>
