<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>From taking the Myers-Briggs test, I received the personality type of entrepreneur. I have an extroverted personality (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2021). This doesn’t surprise me as I like being the centre of attention, I have an observant mental energy, which makes sense because I like to observe situations before I insert myself, when I used to go for interviews in the hospitality industry, I would go for dinner and drinks, I would sit and observe how the staff behaved while on duty and what changes could be made on the service that was provided. When it comes to decision making, I received the thinking nature, this makes sense as I like to have all the facts in front of me before I make decisions, I don’t like to act hastily.  The tactic portion of my personality traits is prospecting, in respect to decision making, planning and work, my understanding is that I am slow to making decisions. This is relatable because I don’t like to make rash decisions, especially around work areas. I like to make decisions in my own time and ensure I have all the facts; I also like to play out scenarios in my head of the repercussions of my actions. The final personality trait from the Myers-Briggs test is identity, for the identity I have a turbulent personality. I always try to improve myself, and somewhat of a perfectionist and driven by success. I have an eye for details, if I don’t like something about myself, I try to change it. In the workplace I believe that hard work gets results a result of this is being promoted from a Bar Attendant to the Duty Manager, as well as completing tasks properly the right way and ensuring that the tasks are perfect before moving on to the next task.</p>
<p>After completing a learning style test, the results showed that I am a solitary learner. This proves to be correct as I like to work alone, by myself and in quiet (Emerald Works, 2021). I am easily distracted so being able to work alone in quiet helps to keep me motivated. This happens mostly in the workplace, as constantly having people talking around me entices me to stop work and to join in the conversation and fall behind in my work. I also need to keep distractions to a minimum while studying as I will lose track on time while focusing on the wrong task and not be able to restart the previous tasks.</p>
<p>After completing a psychometric test for verbal reasoning to assess how well I can make decisions from verbal data and identify critical issues (CareerOne, 2021). Answering six questions right out of 10, I scored a ranking of average. Being able to reach logical conclusions appears to be lacking according to the web site that was used to administer the test. Having worked in an industry that uses these skill regularly I should have scored higher, I will need to improve these skills in order to be proficient in identify critical issues and making logical conclusions.</p>
<p>As a personality type of entrepreneur (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2021), being the centre of attention, and the life of the party. These traits appear to make for a good leader. Being logical minded and be able to make critical decisions, I feel that would make me the natural leader of the group assignment. This could be helpful if nobody wants to take the reigns or organise the group, this could me most beneficial for all members. This could cause issues with other members of the team if they also have the same personality type. Being someone that like to work in silence and alone according to the learning style test (Emerald Works, 2021) could cause major issues while working in the group. Discussing with fellow group members about what work I am undertaking and how the project is progressing is a skill that I have struggled with, as well as being able to identify critical issues. If as a team we discuss the issues with ourselves and our fears of what will happen during the group assignment being able to work through them as a team should bring success to the team, especially if we get to the root of the problem before they become any bigger.</p>
