<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>The idea that I have for a project is a new platform connecting meal delivery services with a means of in game advertising and ordering through a virtual food court. The in-game experience would allow local vendors to provide dynamic advertising on in-game billboards, buildings and other in game product placement. The virtual food court would allow players to browse and order local cuisine and groceries from connected online delivery services like Doordash. This means vendors can target local gamers with tailored specials, or just make gamers aware of their product. This could be integrated into existing gaming platforms with an overview application hosting the virtual cafe, or an entirely new game developed to introduce the idea.</p>
<p>Being a former gamer, ordering food used to annoy me. I would have to stop playing the games I was playing, find my phone and look for some thing to eat using an online delivery service. If the next generation of games or gaming console integrate an overview menu feature like the map screen with all the local vendors and their specials, there will be no need to stop playing your game. In order to use the overview, feature you will need to have the location services on so that local business can pay to have a billboard or advertising in the game and not as a paid add that you see within most games that are free. You can link your credit card or preferred payment method to your account, you could even use in game credits. The in-game credits can be sold for a monetary value.  You can also sell real estate within the game so that these companies can set up an online store that you the player can walk in to and add items to your cart and make a purchase. After the purchase has been completed a drive you to the actual store and pick up your order and deliver it to where your location is or a specified delivery address. This could also be used to send friends that you are playing with meals or the likes without having to leave the game or the comports of your home, like menu log or uber eats but the platform itself is the app and no need to pick up your phone if you are in an area of the game that needs your attention. If the game has a respawn feature you can be taken to the virtual food court to make your order.  Another example of the advertising and virtual food court would be in games that have cooperative elements as players from all over the world joining in on a single game. These players may not be in the same physical location but are able to ask for their locations to send them items from the virtual food court to their house and vice versa. As you are able to talk to these other players you can ask them what they would like, this could be in the form of, “hey, I see you are in Sydney, what do you want for dinner?” one the other player tells you what they want, you enter the virtual food court place the order and after the item is made it gets delivered to the delivery address. Other features could be wanting to buy something for all the players of the game, so you enter the virtual food court by something and add all the players to the delivery address and it gets made by the store closes to them.</p>
<p>The benefits of the advertising could be endless. You can sell of the advertising rights to different companies, like plumbers or electrician, and only the players in the locations that they service will see the advertising. If companies want to expand, they can advertise in other areas they are looking at expanding to. This is a modern twist to an old idea, like radio and tv advertisements. Although in game advertising is not a new concept, in 2004, 34 million dollars was made with in-game advertising (contributors, 2021). This revolutionary idea could boost company profits by considering the use of technology that is already being used in modern society.</p>
<p>The software needed for this assignment will be challenging to say the least, the participants of the group assignment will need to be to consider encrypted credit card details, and addresses, so that there is no theft of personal information. Trying to code for the locations of different businesses in the area that the players are using the virtual food court. Having multiple players online from different areas will need to be able to show what they can order for their friends, so that a local business that for example sell coffee is not used for an interstate or international customers. There will need to be a device that can be used at the restaurant end that can receive and prepare the orders this could be a web-based application that uses cloud-based technologies. A phone application that needs to be developed for the delivery drivers that are taking the orders to the players houses. Creating a game that can utilise the virtual food court or create a platform that can be placed into already existing games. There will need to be constant penetration test done to ensure that product is safe, to ensure that hackers can unlawfully take the information that is stored within the systems that will be developed. There will also need to be components of the application that stops the ordering of items from children that have access to the games that have implemented the virtual food court or have downloaded the game that has been the reason or the development. These are only some of the issues that have the potential to slow down the development of the application. if the virtual food court is to be developed there will be other issues arise that will need to be mitigated to ensure the effective release of the software and hardware.</p>
<p>The outcome of this this application that I have wanted to see in games for some time is being able to order food and beverages with out needing to leave a game and be able to send item to your online friends. Getting something tangible in return for the money spent is the main benefit of this application. This project idea could revolutionise the online gaming world and increase profits for businesses. As we are using technology more and more these days it only makes sense that we add the virtual food court as a new element to the online games that we play with the overview application that host the virtual food court. If done correctly and safely.</p>
